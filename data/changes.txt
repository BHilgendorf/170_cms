Since 1981 we've designed and built a lot of bikes, we've pedaled countless miles and have happily welcomed many owners into the Moots family. At Moots riding has always been a way of life and it's our livelihood so rest assured we are committed to handcrafting bikes and components for many years to come. Proud of our storied history, we have selected several milestones to share.
